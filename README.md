## napi-rs experiments

This repo might eventually become the basis for some SWC wrapping fun, but for now it is just for experimenting with napi-rs.

Right now it just does a silly fibonacci thing.

### Using in node

- `yarn build`
- `node`
- `require('./swcify.node').fibonacci()`

### Running tests

- `yarn build`
- `yarn test`
